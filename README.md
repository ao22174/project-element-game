# PersonalGameProject
 This is a solo bolo project that I, Kyle Verzosa, will be working on as a side-project for the next few months. The game idea I currently have is a roguelike rpg that features inspired elements from hit games such as Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac, as well as inspiration from other games such as Genshin Impact.

 ## Features
 - Character movement
 - Basic level generation
 - Weapon Framework

 ## TODO/ Roadmap
 - Working towards a functioning game, will require
 - Enemies
 - Stages
 - Roguelike elements (Enhancement Cards)
 - NPCs
 - Element System
