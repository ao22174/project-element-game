# PersonalGameProject
 This is a solo bolo project that I, Kyle Verzosa, will be working on as a side-project for the next few months. The game idea I currently have is a roguelike rpg that features inspired elements from hit games such as Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac, as well as inspiration from other games such as Genshin Impact.

 Current Version: PRE MVP (For any progress changes, see the MVP branch)

 ## Features
 - Character movement
 - Basic level generation
 - Weapon Framework
 - Buff/Enhancement Framework
 - Basic Enemy Framework + AI
 - 

 ## TODO/ Roadmap
 - Working towards a functioning game will require
 - Enemies✓
 - Stages✓
 - Roguelike elements (Enhancement Cards)✓
 - NPCs
 - Element System ~

## Currently Working On/ Dev notes
- Currently need to work on the rewards system. Chests and goodies after completing a room that give the player buffs and weapons✓
- Need to create animations for the characters and the enemies
- Need to also rework the proc chance system, to consider the attack speed of the weapon (Currently faster rate weapons benefit from buffs significantly more than slow fire rate weapons) [CURRENTLY ON]
- Would like to rework some Enemy systems such as their knockback when shot, i want them to go a certain distance then stop
- some Reformatting and refactoring needs to be done, specifically in the Generation and the Player Weapon system (It is slowly becoming spaghetti)
